# Carrier
Game demo created for Global Game Jam 2018. Programming by Blair Chisholm and art by Nat DeMenthon. The game was created in under 48 hours using Unity. 

A carrier pigeon who isn’t so good at flying delivers letters on foot instead. Deliver all of your letters and collect $1.50 in change to take the bus home.
